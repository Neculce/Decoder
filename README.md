# Decoder
This python script is a solution for the Decode Runner challenge found in the PwnMe CTF 2025 Qualifiers. 

The script connects to the challenge and receives a hint and a ciphertext. 

The hint is the string that determines which decoder to use to return the correct plaintext.

The ciphers implemented were hand-written using information from dcode.fr and Wikipedia.

Ciphers used:
- Baudot
- Guitar Chords
- LeetCode
- Morbit Cipher
- Latin Gibberish
- Tritemius
- Wabun Code (Japanese Morse Code)
- Shankar Speech Defect
- Chuck Norris Unary Code
- NATO Phonetic Alphabet (noted as Initials)
